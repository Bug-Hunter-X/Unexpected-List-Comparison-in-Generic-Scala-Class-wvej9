# Unexpected List Comparison in Generic Scala Class

This code demonstrates a subtle issue in Scala when comparing lists within a generic class. The `==` operator compares references, not the content of the lists, leading to unexpected results.

## Problem
The `myMethod` function in `MyClass` is intended to check for equality of the underlying `value` objects. This works as expected for primitive types (like `Int` and `String`), but fails for `List` types.  Even when two lists contain the same elements, the comparison will be `false` if they are distinct list instances.

## Solution
To correctly compare the content of the lists, the `equals` method or the `===` operator (from the Scalatest library) should be used instead of `==`.
